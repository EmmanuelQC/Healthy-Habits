# Healthy-Habits
The app provides health related safety reminders and additional insights

This app is a compilation of useful resources and features. Its main aim is to spread awareness about being prepared for a health crisis and educate you on how to do so in the future.

You can keep a log on the daily times you've washed your hands and a daily point system to keep yourself motivated.
The app includes a collection of online health related resources for convenient use.

It was built for an academic project and submitted for a final exam(IGCSE Global Perspectives).
We created a site to publicise it after facing problems with releasing it on multiple app stores due to new Covid-19 regulations restricting many lone developers. Here is the link: https://hhhhealthyhomehabits.weebly.com
